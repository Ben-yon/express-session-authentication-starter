## What's on this branch?

This branch contains a single file that is the entire application.

This repository is supplementary to my tutorial on [authenticating users in Node, Express, and Angular](https://zachgoll.github.io/blog/2019/choosing-authentication-strategy).

### Setup

You will need to create a `.env` file in the base of the project with the following contents:

```
DB_STRING=
SECRET=
```
Now, run the app.

```
node app.js
```
